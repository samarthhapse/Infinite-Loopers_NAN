The scam operator, known by the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.\n\nTo protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.\n\nThe scam involving crypto QR code phishing works as follows: The victim enters the crypto address for which they need a QR code. Then, when they generate the QR code on one of the fraudulent crypto QR code websites, it always displays the same QR code on the final page, containing the fraudster's crypto address. Regardless of which crypto address the victim initially entered, the QR code will always belong to the fraudster, and the victim remains unaware. If someone sends cryptocurrency to the victim's &quot;QR code&quot;, the funds will actually go to the fraudster, as the QR code belongs to them and displays their crypto address.\n\nHis email accounts: The operator is known to use the following email addresses: &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; and &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;.\nDue to this abuse, Proton Team has already banned the account &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;, while the account &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; remains active.\n\nHis YouTube profile: The YouTube account &quot;https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielenesto&quot;, named Gabriel Enesto (as of 11/25/2023) with Channel-ID: &quot;UCO5q0rVGQs4F4IKnNUbRERg&quot; belongs to the notorious individual known as &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;.\n\nHis Trustpilot profile: Additionally, the Trustpilot account &quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63c0b6a16503ee0012e7c049&quot; also belongs to this despicable character.\nHe utilizes these platforms to defame legitimate companies due to the banning of some of his phishing domains and to sabotage his competitors, driven solely by his insatiable greed.\nAlso, &quot;Cryptofbi007&quot; and &quot;iCryptofbi&quot;, who is named Gabriel Enesto on Trustpilot, changed his country to France in the settings, which is why it shows FR on his clearly fake reviews; however, he is originally from Russia, using this method to manipulate both people and law enforcement agencies.\n\nHis Reddit profile: The fraudster known as &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; went to the extent of creating a public and restricted Reddit group called &quot;qr_code_&quot; to bolster his deceptive crypto QR phishing scam websites in search engine rankings. This group can be seen at &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/qr_code_/&quot;.\nTo further his illicit activities, the fraudster operates under the Reddit username &quot;Itchy-Attention8905&quot;. More information about his activities and profile can be found at &quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Itchy-Attention8905/&quot;.\n\nHis Medium Profile: The Medium profile &quot;@cryptofbi007&quot;, which can be visited at &quot;https://medium.com/@cryptofbi007&quot; (banned), also belongs to the Russian cybercriminal who goes by &quot;icryptofbi&quot; on BitcoinTalk.\n\nHis GitHub profile: Additionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 (banned) , attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems.\nHere are the relevant repositories and issues:\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080\nWhile &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.\n\nI obtained some of his social media accounts by reporting the phishing websites to domain registrars and hosting providers. The Russian individual behind these fraudulent activities went by the names &quot;icryptofbi&quot; or &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. Consequently, I received delayed messages that contained pertinent information from this fraudster.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as &quot;Crypto-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;btc-qr-code.se&quot;, and &quot;crypto-qr-code.su&quot;. These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4W\n\nThe phishing websites &quot;usdt-qr.com&quot; and &quot;ltc-qr-code.su&quot; are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;, indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims. It is of utmost importance to raise awareness about these fraudulent activities to protect potential targets from falling prey to these scams.\n\nTo aid in identification, please find below a list of all known phishing crypto addresses and domains associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;:\n\nPhishing Crypto Addresses by &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;:\n1.

        "description": "Crypto users, please be cautious and aware of the fraudulent activities carried out by an individual named &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. This person has created multiple fake crypto QR code generator websites, including &quot;xmr-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;xmr-qr-code-generator.com&quot;, and &quot;xmrqrcode.com&quot;. These websites generate QR codes that only direct funds to the scammer's Monero (XMR) address: 84gHdF7rArqU6e9cbmfPi9iJR2QUU7CoX1XJEvAmQWXmSUkj3C3LVLW3ioHiqNc8iwGPcxCv5Fk13ZY k9fxQFLKuKEW54r6.\n\nPlease note that a saved archive of the phishing website containing the fraudster's Monero address can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20231122120748/https://xmr-qr-code.com/8.php\n\nThis phishing scam involves tricking users into sending their cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet through a QR code, resulting in significant financial losses. The scam operator, known by the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.\n\nTo protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.\n\nThe operator is known to use the following email addresses: &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; and &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;\nAdditionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 , attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems.\nHere are the relevant repositories and issues:\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080\nWhile &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as &quot;Crypto-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;btc-qr-code.se&quot;, and &quot;crypto-qr-code.su&quot;. These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4W.\n\nThe phishing websites &quot;usdt-qr.com&quot; and &quot;ltc-qr-code.su&quot; are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;, indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims.

This website, operated by an individual based in Russia, has been systematically scamming unsuspecting crypto users and has already swindled over $285,000 as of November 22, 2023 and much more other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe evidence of this criminal activity can be verified through the following blockchain link: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BtMBFxM2diH24hFZTpD5W2aa6F2YEP2NE\nIt is alarming to see the significant financial losses incurred by innocent victims due to the operators' deceitful actions.\n\n\n\n&quot;Exchanger24.org&quot; presents itself as a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange platform, preying on clueless crypto users seeking to make transactions. Once users provide their sensitive information, including their cryptocurrency holdings and personal details, they become vulnerable to identity theft and financial exploitation. The operator of this phishing platform, based on available information, is believed to be located in Russia. It is crucial to exercise caution and raise awareness about this scam to protect individuals from falling victim to their deceptive practices.\n\n\n\nIt has come to our attention that the operators of the phishing website &quot;Exchanger24.org&quot; engage in unethical practices by flagging negative reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and Sitejabber to have them removed. These actions aim to deceive more unsuspecting individuals and increase the chances of successful scams since genuine negative reviews get removed due to the lack of evidence for orders on a completely fake website. A victim has provided a detailed report confirming these actions, which can be found at: https://neomarket.ir/exchanger24-org-is-a-scam/\n\n\n\nThank you for your urgent attention to this matter and don't get scammed by these kind of phishing sites.",

You have nothing to worry about,\nbecause I keep my word at all times.\n\nThat is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\ntaking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\nIf you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\n\nBelow is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:\n12xHi1pTom3od4CUDGMxAcABboM1W8iej1\n\nAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\n\nThe following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\n&gt;&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\nIf I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them)\nyour nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,\nsince all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.\n\nThings that may be concerning you:\n&gt;&gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nBreathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,\nI will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).\n&gt;&gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.\nTrust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!\n\nWe are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!\nMy recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.  \nI have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.  I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.   Let's settle it this way:\nYou transfer $400 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.  After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.   \nThis is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.  In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.   \nHere is my bitcoin wallet: bc1qqkjevepet3y3ylpthxqxhj2alkvr99ld7ylmq3",

Mark my words, I never lie.\n\nThat is a great bargain with a low price, \nI assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recording and tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.\nIn case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.\n\nHere is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 12xHi1pTom3od4CUDGMxAcABboM1W8iej1\n\nAttention please! I can specified my Bitcoin wallet with spaces,\nplease make sure that you key-in my bitcoin address without spaces to be sure that your coins successfully reach my wallet!\n\nFrom now on, you have only 50 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, more than two days).\n\nThe following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:\n~&gt;&gt; Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).\n~&gt;&gt; Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services.\n In addition, it's a bad idea if you want to share it with your friends, hoping they would help. \n If I happen to find out (knowing my awesome skills, it can be done effortlessly, \n because I have all your devices and accounts under my control and unceasing observation) - kinky videos of yours will be share to public the same day. \n~&gt;&gt; Abstain from trying to look for me - that would not lead anywhere either. Cryptocurrency transactions are absolutely anonymous and cannot be tracked.\n~&gt;&gt; Abstain from reinstalling your OS on devices or throwing them away.\n That would not solve the problem as well, since all your personal videos are already uploaded and stored at remote servers.\n\nThings you may be confused about:\n~&gt;&gt; That your funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nChill, I can track down any transactions right away, so upon funds transfer I will receive a notification as well,\nsince I still control your devices (my trojan virus has ability of controlling all processes remotely, just like TeamViewer).\n~&gt;&gt; That I am going to share your dirty videos after receiving money transfer from you. \nHere you need to trust me, because there is absolutely no point to still bother you after receiving money.\nMoreover, if I really wanted all those videos would be available to public long time ago! \n\nI believe we can still handle this situation on fair terms!\n\nHere is my last advice to you... in future you better ensure you stay away from this kind of situations!\nMy advice - don't forget to regularly update your passwords to feel completely secure.",

Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,\nsince all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.\n\nThings that may be concerning you:\n&gt;&gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nBreathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,\nI will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).\n&gt;&gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.\nTrust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!\n\nWe are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!\nMy recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I've been watching you for a few months now.\n\nThe fact is that your computer has been infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.\nIf you are not familiar with this, I will explain.\nTrojan virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.\nThis means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.\nI also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.\n\nWhy did your antivirus not detect malware? The malware I used is driver based and I update its signatures every six hours. Hence your AV is unable to detect its presence.\nI made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.\n\nWith one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.\nI can also make public all your email correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, transfer $770 in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search &quot;buy bitcoin&quot;).\n\nMy Bitcoin address is: 1AyLWnrMcToF2vBnsE3SzwirXFhuc4jpUC\n\nAfter confirming your payment, I will delete the video immediately, and that's it. You will never hear from me again.\nI will give you 60 hours (more than two days) to pay. I will get a notice, when you open this email, and the timer will start.\nFiling a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my Bitcoin address.\n\nI never make any mistakes.

        "description": "Greetings!\n\nI have to share bad news with you. Approximately a few months ago, I gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing. After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.\n\nHere is the sequence of events:\n\nSome time ago, I purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to buy it online). I have easily managed to log in to your email account\n\nOne week later, I have already installed the Cobalt Strike &quot;Beacon&quot; on the Operating Systems of all the devices you use to access your email. It was not hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails). All ingenious is simple. :).\n\nThis software provides me with access to all your devices controllers (e.g., your microphone, video camera, and keyboard).\nI have downloaded all your information, data, photos, videos, documents, files, web browsing history to my servers. I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history, and contacts list.\n\nMy virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based) and hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter.\n\nWhile gathering information about you, i have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites. You love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, i have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show how you masturbate and reach orgasms.\n\nIf you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse, and all your videos will be shared with your friends, colleagues, and relatives. Considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch (you perfectly know what I mean), it will cause a real catastrophe for you.\n\nI also have no issue at all with making them available for public access (leaked and exposed all data).\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Under the rules of the law, you face a heavy fine or arrest.\nI guess you don't want that to happen.\n\nLet's settle it this way:\n\nYou transfer $44000 USD to me and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away. After that, we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me. I keep my word.\n\nThat is a fair deal, and the price is relatively low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now. If you don't know how to purchase and transfer Bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine.\n\nYou need to send that amount here Bitcoin wallet:\nbc1qqcxyavu6pjdnjxzjue2x3l85yrjp3nw309mckt\n\n(The price is not negotiable).\nYou have 5 days in order to make the payment from the moment you opened this email.\n\nDo not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server).\nDo not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.\n\nThis is an APT Hacking Group. Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.\nI will monitor your every move until I get paid.\nIf you keep your end of the agreement, you won't hear from me ever again.\n\nEverything will be done fairly!\nOne more thing. Don't get caught in similar kinds of situations anymore in the future!\nMy advice: keep changing all your passwords frequently.",

        "description": "Hi there!\n\nI regret to inform you about some sad news for you.\nApproximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.\nMoving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.\n\nGo ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:\nInitially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).\nEvidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account : email\n\nWithin the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.\nFrankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).\nYeah, geniuses are among us.\n\nBecause of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).\nAs result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.\nMoreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.\nMy unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.\n\nHence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...\n\nDuring the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,\nI also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.\nTurns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.\nAs a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,\nand later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.\n\nIf until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,\nincluding your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.\nMoreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.\nI sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,\n(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.\n\nThere is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:\nYou make a transaction of $670 to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),\nhence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.\nAfter that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.\nAdditionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,\nbecause I keep my word at all times.\n\nThat is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\ntaking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\nIf you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\n\nBelow is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1BkFNE2b5oTpZLxeu4jRJbypJCMAxSt5Ug\n\nAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\n\nThe following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\n&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\n&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\nIf I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them)\nyour nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.\n&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\n&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,\nsince all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.\n\nThings that may be concerning you:\n&gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nBreathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,\nI will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).\n&gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.\nTrust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!\n\nWe are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner.\nBye.",

        "description": "Hi. How are you?\n\nI know, it\u2019s unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.\nFew months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.\nAfterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.\n\nHere is the history of how it could become possible:\nAt first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).\nAs result, I could easily log in to your email account [email\u00a0protected].\n\nOne week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.\nFrankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).\nEverything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!\n\nMy software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.\nI could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.\nI can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.\nVirus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.\n\nHence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.\n\nAs I was gathering information about you, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.\nYou actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.\nI could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.\n\nIf you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,\nit only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.\nI can also make those vids become accessible by public.\nI honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,\n(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.\n\nHowever, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:\nEverything you are required to do is a single transfer of $990 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),\nand once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.\nAfter that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.\nMake no doubt that I will fulfill my part.\n\nThis is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.\nIf you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process \u2013 it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.\n\nHere is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q73lm30rgv6h9wy42y88t0r8prjh9l9pzpvvm9c\n\nYou should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.\n\nThe following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:\n#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.\nAfter I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) \u2013 your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.\n#Do not try searching for me \u2013 there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.\n#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.\n\nThe following list contains things you should not be worried about:\n#That your money won\u2019t reach my account.\n\u2013 Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,\nI will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).\n#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.\n\u2013 Trust me, it\u2019s pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!\n\nLet\u2019s make this deal in a fair manner!\n\nOwh, one more thing\u2026in future it is best that you don\u2019t involve yourself in similar situations any longer!\nOne last advice from me \u2013 recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts",
