# Blockchain Visualizer
SIH'23 Final project- Blockchain Visualizer

# Problem Statement
De-anonymization for monitoring and tracking of illegal activities performed using cryptocurrency transaction technology.

# Structure
This is a tool which can help us know the person behind the wallet address.
1. Blockchain Visualizer ( Helps in tracing the money flow )
2. Machine Learning Model ( Helps in predicting whether a wallet addr is malicious or not )
3. Report tool ( Extention of visualizer which gives the details of the person responsible for illicit activities )


# Solution (Prototype)
A mechanism to keep an eye on and trace illegal activity. We can follow the money flow and blacklist any wallet address with visualizer's assistance. Then, using a machine learning model, we can determine whether the wallet address is malicious based on a variety of factors, including the transaction amount, sender and recipient addresses, and many more.
Next, we are using deep web scraping to collect data regarding cryptocurrency frauds, and we compare that address to the malicious address that the machine learning model predicted.
